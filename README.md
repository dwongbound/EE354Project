### Overview:
Planning to implement the Doodle Jump game. The user will attempt to move the doodle up as far as the doodle can by jumping on blocks. If the doodle drops and reaches the bottom of the screen without jumping on a block, then it is game over.

### State Machine: 
#### States
- INI: Initial
- UP: Doodle moves up for a certain distance
- DOWN: Doodle drops
- DONE: Game over
- Powerup: Doodle gets a rocket and moves up (implement if thereâ€™s extra time)

### Features (if time permits):
* Mobs
* Brown Platforms (breakable)
* Blue Platforms (move side to side)
* Map Holes
* Springs
* Random Map
